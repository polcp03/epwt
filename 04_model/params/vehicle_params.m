% >>> LOGGING HAZARD - status 2026-10-09 <<<
% An older note here said the VESC had si_gear_ratio = 6.5 (the old 72/11
% setup), i.e. speed channels 28 % high. The exports in 03_hardware/vesc/
% (2026-09-09 and the re-export of 2026-10-01) both read si_gear_ratio = 8.363,
% so that note was stale. The 2026-10-01 re-export also fixed
% si_motor_poles 14 -> 6 (p = 3 MEASURED), which DOES enter the speed channel.
% Still open: si_wheel_diameter = 0.30 m on the device vs 2*r_roll = 0.31 m
% here (~3 %). For logs taken BEFORE 2026-10-01 the poles error applies; the
% factor depends on the formula the firmware uses - check before rescaling.

%% 2. Wheels and tyres
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Rear (driven): 13 x 5.00-6 TR13 on a 6 in rim, pneumatic knobby.
% 13 in nominal -> 330.2 mm outer diameter, 165.1 mm unloaded radius.
veh.d_wheel_nom  = 0.3302;         % [m] MEASURED (nominal tyre size, 13 in)
veh.r_wheel_nom  = veh.d_wheel_nom / 2;        % 165.1 mm

% Loaded rolling radius. NOT the nominal radius.
% Pol's observation 2026-09-07: most of the mass sits on the rear axle and the
% tyres run at low pressure, so the rear tyre visibly squashes ("cae bastante").
% Typical deflection for a low-pressure knobby under this kind of load is
% 5-10 % of the unloaded radius. Taking ~6 %:
veh.r_roll       = 0.155;          % [m] ASSUMED, 165.1 mm - 6 %
veh.r_roll_range = [0.150 0.160];  % [m] plausible band until measured
% >>> This is the single most leveraged unmeasured number in the vehicle. <<<
% It divides torque to give tractive force AND multiplies speed, so a 6 % error
% is a 6 % error in predicted acceleration and in predicted top speed at once.
%
% HOW TO MEASURE IT (5 minutes, needs the rear wheels back on):
%   1. Rider seated on the quad, normal tyre pressure.
%   2. Mark the rear tyre and the ground at the contact patch.
%   3. Push the quad in a straight line for exactly 10 wheel revolutions.
%   4. Measure the distance travelled, D.
%   5. r_roll = D / (10 * 2*pi)
% This measures the radius the vehicle actually rolls on, deflection included.
% Rolling, not a ruler: a ruler measures the deformed shape, not the effective
% radius, and those are not the same thing.

% Vehicle mass without rider. History - it was ESTIMATED from two sources:
%   - 45 kg stock platform minus ~5 kg from the lead-acid -> Li-ion swap
%   - Pol lifted the quad 2026-09-07 and judged it "about 40 kg"
% Two independent estimates landing on the same number is worth more than one,
% but neither is a scale. Weigh it when convenient - see the sensitivity note
% at the bottom of this file for how much it is worth.

%% 7. WHERE THE MODEL ERROR ACTUALLY COMES FROM
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Run this once mot is loaded (motor_params.m) and the priorities are obvious:
%
%   rotor inertia            1.558e-4 kg*m^2      0.4 % of the total
%   vehicle, seen from motor 3.78e-2  kg*m^2     99.6 % of the total
%
% The rotor is 250 times lighter than the vehicle it has to accelerate. So:
%   - refining J_rotor beyond its current +/-14 % changes the answer by 0.06 %
%   - a 10 % error in m_total or r_roll changes it by 10 %
%
% Sensitivity of predicted acceleration, in descending order:
%   r_roll     +/-6 %   ASSUMED   <- roll-out test, 5 min, needs wheels
%   m_total    done     MEASURED  2026-10-08, scale (38 + 72 kg)
%   Crr        range    ASSUMED   <- coastdown
%   eta_drive  range    ASSUMED   <- coastdown
%   CdA        range    ASSUMED   <- coastdown, weakly observable below 50 km/h
%   J_rotor    +/-14 %  MEASURED  <- already far better than needed
% The full one-at-a-time sweep over these ranges, with numbers, is in
% 04_model/results/C01_predictions_table.md (scripts/run_predictions_L1.m).
%
% Every hour spent on the motor from here buys less than a minute spent on the
% chassis. The machine is now the best-characterised part of this vehicle.
