%  SIGN / SCALING CONVENTION  (verified against the firmware, not assumed)
%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%  VESC uses the amplitude-invariant (K = 1) Clarke/Park transform and the
%  standard per-phase (wye-equivalent) dq model. From mcpwm_foc.c:4650 and
%  virtual_motor.c:305-330:
%
%     vd = Rs*id + Ld*d(id)/dt - we*Lq*iq
%     vq = Rs*iq + Lq*d(iq)/dt + we*(Ld*id + lambda_m)
%     Te = 1.5 * p * (lambda_m + (Ld - Lq)*id) * iq
%
%  This is exactly the equation set of the Simulink/Simscape PMSM block, so
%  R, Ld, Lq and lambda_m below drop straight into it with no rescaling.
%
%  IMPORTANT - the phase-vs-line question is RESOLVED, see EXP-001:
%  mcpwm_foc_measure_resistance() computes R = norm(v_dq) / norm(i_dq) with the
%  rotor frame locked (mcpwm_foc.c:1869-1885, sampling at :4144). Both are
%  dq-frame phase quantities, so foc_motor_r is the PER-PHASE resistance, not
%  line-to-line. A multimeter across two phases must read about 2*Rs.

% Pole pairs.
% MEASURED 2026-09-06 by Hall pulse counting, drivetrain assembled.
% One hall line produces p electrical cycles per mechanical motor revolution.
% One turn of the 92T rear sprocket = 92/11 = 8.364 motor turns, so the
% expected count is 8.364*p: 25.1 for p=3, 33.5 for p=4.
% Counted 25, repeatable. -> p = 3, unambiguous.
% Side effect: this also confirms the 92/11 gear ratio. A wrong ratio would
% not have landed the count on a valid row of that table.
mot.p            = 3;              % [-]  MEASURED

% Stator resistance, per phase.
% Mean of THREE consecutive VESC detections, 2026-09-07, all at I = 40.00 A:
%   27.83 / 28.14 / 28.10 mOhm  ->  28.02 +/- 0.14 mOhm, 0.5 % spread.
% Still a VESC_ESTIMATE: it includes MOSFET on-resistance and dead-time, so it
% is the resistance the CURRENT LOOP sees, an upper bound on the winding
% copper. That is the right number for simulating the loop; it is not the right
% number for a copper-loss or thermal model. Temperature of the run unknown
% (no motor sensor), and copper moves 0.39 %/K.

% Inductances. VESC stores the average L and the saliency difference:
%   Lq = L + diff/2 ,  Ld = L - diff/2      (foc_math.c:782-783)
% Same three detections at I = 40.00 A:
%   L      : 105.95 / 106.10 / 105.96 uH  ->  106.00 +/- 0.07 uH  (0.06 %)
%   Lq-Ld  :  13.41 /  13.91 /  13.31 uH  ->   13.54 +/- 0.26 uH  (1.9 %)
mot.L_avg        = 106.00e-6;      % [H]  VESC_ESTIMATE, 3 runs
mot.L_diff       = 13.54e-6;       % [H]  VESC_ESTIMATE, 3 runs
mot.Ld           = mot.L_avg - mot.L_diff/2;   %  99.23 uH
mot.Lq           = mot.L_avg + mot.L_diff/2;   % 112.77 uH
% Saliency ratio Lq/Ld = 1.136.
% RESOLVED: the saliency is repeatable to 1.9 % when the detection settings are
% held fixed. The old 9.45 / 16.90 uH spread came from runs at DIFFERENT
% detection currents (the 2026-07-29 run used 97.85 A against 40 A here), i.e.
% it is magnetic saturation, not noise. Saliency is therefore a function of
% current, which is exactly what an MTPA table would have to capture. Anything
% built on a single saliency number is only valid at that current.

% Permanent-magnet flux linkage (peak phase value, amplitude-invariant dq).
% MEASURED 2026-09-07 by open-circuit back-EMF, independently of the VESC.
% Motor disconnected from the inverter, scope across two phases, drill drive.
%   lambda = A1_fundamental / (sqrt(3) * 2*pi*f)
%
% Two raw-data captures (06_data/2026-09-07_back-emf/raw/scope_txt/), 1310 and 2510 rpm mechanical:
%   16.826 and 16.883 mWb  ->  agreement 0.17 % across a 2:1 speed range.
% Amplitude taken as sqrt(2)*RMS of the fundamental band, NOT the FFT peak:
% the drill speed wobbles ~1-2 % inside the window, which smears the peak and
% biases a peak-picked amplitude low. The RMS estimator is immune to that, and
% it is what collapses the two captures from 1.08 % apart to 0.17 %.
% Script: 04_model/scripts/backemf_from_csv.py
mot.lambda_m     = 0.016855;       % [Wb]  MEASURED

% Superseded, kept for traceability:
% An earlier pass read 43 oscilloscope SCREENSHOTS pixel by pixel and fitted
% A1 vs f through the origin -> 16.51 mWb, R^2 = 0.9911, intercept 1.3 sigma
% from zero. That is 2.0 % below the raw-data value, from the same speed-wobble
% bias plus 47 mV of pixel resolution. It agreeing to 2 % validates the pixel
% calibration, but the raw data supersedes it.
% Scripts: 04_model/scripts/backemf_extract.py + backemf_fit.py

% The VESC's own detection gives 15.92 mWb, 5.5 % LOWER. That sign is the one
% theory predicts: the VESC infers lambda from the voltage it *commands*, which
% is below the voltage actually applied because of dead time, and it subtracts
% an R that is itself inflated by the MOSFET drop. Both errors push lambda down.
% The agreement is therefore a genuine cross-validation, not a coincidence.
% THIRD, INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION - 2026-09-07, no-load steady state.
% Held at the duty ceiling (0.9486) for 443 logged samples: 16440 ERPM,
% |v_dq| = 28.886 V, iq = 1.883 A, Vbat 52.77 V.
%     lambda = (|v| - R*i) / we  =  16.748 mWb
% The VESC reports the voltage it COMMANDS, not the one it applies. Dead time
% costs td*fsw*Vbus = 0.12us * 30kHz * 52.77 = 0.19 V. Adding it back:
%     lambda = 16.858 mWb   vs   16.855 mWb from the scope  ->  0.02 % apart.
% Two methods sharing no assumption, agreeing to two parts in ten thousand.
% It also explains the detection's 5.5 % shortfall: the same 0.19 V absolute
% error is a much larger fraction of the low voltage present during detection.
mot.lambda_m_nl  = 0.016858;       % [Wb] MEASURED, no-load telemetry route

% The VESC detection (3 runs, 2026-09-07): 15.978 / 15.859 / 15.919 mWb
% -> 15.919 +/- 0.049 mWb, repeatable to 0.3 % but 5.5 % LOW, as above.
mot.lambda_m_vesc = 0.015919;      % [Wb] what the CONTROLLER believes it has.
% Use mot.lambda_m for the plant and mot.lambda_m_vesc wherever the model
% reproduces the VESC observer - the 5.5 % mismatch is real and lives in the
% hardware, not in the model.

% Back-EMF waveform is not a pure sinusoid. MEASURED harmonic content of the
% line-to-line voltage, identical in both captures (share of the fundamental):
%    5th  4.0 %   7th  8.1 %   11th  2.0 %   13th  1.4 %   -> THD 9.2-9.6 %
% No 3rd and no 9th, as it must be: triplen harmonics are in phase in all
% three phases and cancel in any line-to-line voltage. Their absence is a
% check that the measurement itself is sound.
% A dq model assumes a sinusoid, so it will not reproduce the torque ripple
% these produce (mainly 6th-order in the rotor frame, from the 5th and 7th).
% Fine at vehicle level; remember it before blaming a correlation gap on
% something else.

% At the no-load speed the drag splits 44 % dry / 56 % viscous.
% Mechanical time constant J/b = 1.12 s.
%
% ACCURACY: the 14 % is the spread between the three coast-downs, each with
% only 12-13 samples because the VESC logs at 15 Hz. J is NOT from the clean
% two-test subtraction (accelerate at known current, then coast): the spin-up
% lasted ~0.3 s and produced 3 aliased samples, useless. It is instead the
% coast-down slope anchored on the steady-state drag, which is a sound method
% but leans on Kt, hence on lambda_m.
% To tighten it: cap l_current_max to ~10 A so the spin-up takes 2-3 s, and
% log as fast as the tool allows. Then the subtraction method works and J
% stops depending on Kt at all.
%
% VESC no-load current si_motor_nl_current = 1 A is a CONFIG placeholder. The
