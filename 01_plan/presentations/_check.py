"""Find text that overflows its box, before rendering anything.

python-pptx does not measure text, so a box that is too small produces a file
that opens fine and looks broken. This walks the built .pptx, re-wraps every
paragraph with the real Arial metrics, and reports the shapes whose text does
not fit. It is the only reliable guard against the one defect that keeps
coming back.
